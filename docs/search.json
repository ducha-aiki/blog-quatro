    "text": "Coarse-to-fine scheme\nI check 100 paper titles + abstracts, I skim through maybe 10, I read carefully one or two papers. Why? The most of papers are not relevant to me as a computer vision researcher. Some of the papers are bad. From those, which are good, the most important thing is their main message, not some details. And only little number of papers are worth reading – for me. For you that would be different 1 or 2 papers out of 100, but likely not more."
